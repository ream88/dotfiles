## Context Management

Context is your most important resource. Proactively use subagents (Agent tool) to keep exploration, research, and verbose operations out of the main conversation.

**Default to spawning agents for:**
- Codebase exploration (reading 3+ files to answer a question)
- Research tasks (web searches, doc lookups, investigating how something works)
- Code review or analysis (produces verbose output)
- Any investigation where only the summary matters

**Stay in main context for:**
- Direct file edits the user requested
- Short, targeted reads (1-2 files)
- Conversations requiring back-and-forth
- Tasks where user needs intermediate steps

**Rule of thumb:** If a task will read more than ~3 files or produce output the user doesn't need to see verbatim, delegate it to a subagent and return a summary.
